Here's a step-by-step guide for migrating this workflow to the CityOfLosAngeles organization, formatted for a README.md file:

# Setting Up the Create Develop Branches Workflow

## Migrating to CityOfLosAngeles Organization

Follow these steps to set up the workflow in the organization:

### 1. Copy the Workflow File

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory in the CityOfLosAngeles/oof-latax-ci-cd repository
2. Create a new file named `create-develop-branches.yml`
3. Copy the entire workflow code from the test repository into this file
4. Commit the changes

### 2. Update Organization Default

1. Open the `create-develop-branches.yml` file
2. Locate the `organization` input parameter (around line 13-17)
3. Change the default value from:
   ```yaml
   default: 'vishnu-parandhaman'
   ```
   to:
   ```yaml
   default: 'CityOfLosAngeles'
   ```
4. Commit the changes

### 3. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Log in to GitHub with an account that has admin access to the CityOfLosAngeles organization
2. Go to your GitHub account settings (click your profile picture and select Settings)
3. Navigate to "Developer settings" → "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token"
5. Give it a descriptive name like "Repository Management for oof-latax-ci-cd"
6. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `admin:org` (if you need to manage organization settings)
7. Click "Generate token"
8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the generated token immediately - you won't be able to see it again

### 4. Add the PAT as a Repository Secret

1. Navigate to the CityOfLosAngeles/oof-latax-ci-cd repository
2. Go to "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `PAT_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste the token you copied in step 3
6. Click "Add secret"

### 5. Running the Workflow

1. Go to the "Actions" tab of the repository
2. Select the "Create Develop Branches" workflow from the list
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter a comma-separated list of repositories to process
5. Verify the organization is set to "CityOfLosAngeles"
6. Click "Run workflow"

The workflow will process each repository in the list, creating a develop branch for those that don't already have one and skipping empty repositories.
